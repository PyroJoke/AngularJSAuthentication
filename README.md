AngularJS Authentication
=======================

Tutorial shows Authentication in AngularJS with ASP.NET Web API 2 and Owin Middleware using access tokens and refresh tokens approach. 

In this fork I've added basic test harness for AngularJS application. Configured karma with development and CI modes. Difference you can find in karma.conf.js (dev) and karma-CI.conf.js (CI).

- To install node modules run "npm install" in "AngularJSAuthentication.Web.Tests" folder. Surely you should have node installed.

-To install bower modules run "bower install" in  "AngularJSAuthentication.Web.Tests" and "AngularJSAuthentication.Web".

-Also, make sure that karma cli is installed globaly. It can be done with this command "npm install -g karma-cli".
